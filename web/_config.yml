description: >
  Inferno on <a href="https://inferno.hl7.org.au">hl7.org.au</a> is a public service for running select FHIR conformance tests built with Inferno. This includes reference tests that target the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/" target="_blank">AU Core Implementation Guide</a> which are packaged into a Test Kit. <a href="https://sparked.csiro.au/" target="_blank">The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator</a> hopes to make additional Test Kits available in alignment with HL7 AU FHIR Implementation Guides as they are developed and released.
