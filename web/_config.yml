subtitle: HL7® FHIR® Testing using reference test kits built with Inferno by the Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator
description: >
  Inferno on <a href="https://inferno.hl7.org.au">hl7.org.au</a> is a public service for running select FHIR conformance tests built with Inferno. This includes reference tests that target the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/" target="_blank">AU Core Implementation Guide</a> which are packaged into a Test Kit. <a href="https://sparked.csiro.au/" target="_blank">The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator</a> hopes to make additional Test Kits available in alignment with HL7 AU FHIR Implementation Guides as they are developed and released.

            Inferno is an <a href="https://github.com/inferno-framework">open
              source</a> tool for creating, executing and sharing automated
            conformance tests for the FHIR Standard. Inferno on hl7.org.au
            hosts several tests created with Inferno, but Inferno is designed so
            anyone can create and host their own tests.

      - name: "Create your own tests"
        description: <p>
            Inferno is as flexible as the FHIR standard, and tests need to be created for each unique FHIR use case.
            The Inferno Framework provides tools and common approaches to testing systems for FHIR conformance. Visit
            the <a href="https://inferno-framework.github.io">Inferno Framework Documentation Site</a> to learn more.
          </p>
      - name: "Run your own Inferno Instance"
        description: <p>
            Inferno makes it easy to run tests on your local machine or host a
            shared copy behind your firewall. Inferno tests are packaged in
            Test Kits, which are standalone applications tuned to Implementation
            Guide or certification criteria. Each Test Kit on Inferno on hl7.org.au provides a link
            to its repository where you can learn how to download and run it locally.
          </p>
      - name: "Integrate with Inferno"
        description: <p>
            Inferno's user interface is powered by an open, full-featured API to enable integration into external
            tools or continuous integration pipelines.
            Learn more in the <a href="https://inferno-framework.github.io">Inferno Framework Documentation Site</a>.
          </p>
      - name: "Additional Tools"
        description: <p>
            Comprehensive testing solutions need more than just tests. Inferno
            provides additional utilities, such as Reference Applications, that
            can be optionally integrated alongside tests within Inferno Test
            Kits.
